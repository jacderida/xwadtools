# XWadTools Mirror

This is a collection of WAD editing and viewing tools I think was originally made available around 2001 and was mainly intended for use on Unix systems, but to be able to compile on Windows too.

I don't know how it was originally distributed or made available.

The original README contains some more information, and there's a small [entry](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/XWadTools) on the Doom wiki.

I've now made some modifications to it. If you want the original copy, you can revert this repo to the first commit.
